I am a Ph.D. student at the [Division of Automatic Control](http://www.control.isy.liu.se/), [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.isy.liu.se/) at [Linköping University](https://liu.se/). My research interests include sensor fusion, system identification, and machine learning. 

In the spring of 2021, I defended my licentiate thesis titled XX at Linköping University. Previously, I received a BSc. in Applied physics and electrical engineering and my master's in applied mathematics at Linköping University. In the second semester of the master's, he spent in Eindhoven, Netherlands, at [Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/).
