About me
======
I am a Ph.D. from the [Division of Automatic Control](http://www.control.isy.liu.se/), [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.isy.liu.se/) at [Linköping University](https://liu.se/). My research interests include sensor fusion, system identification, and machine learning. 

On November 17, 2023, I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis [Approximative Uncertainty in Neural Network Predictions](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-198552). The presentation and defense are available [online](https://vimeo.com/885631444/8589e231f0?share=copy). 
In the spring of 2021, I defended my licentiate thesis titled [Uncertainties in Neural Networks A System Identification Approach](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-174720) at Linköping University. Previously, I received a BSc. in Applied physics and electrical engineering and my master's in applied mathematics at Linköping University. In the second semester of the master's, he spent in Eindhoven, Netherlands, at [Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/).
